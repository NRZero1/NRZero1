### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**NRZero1/NRZero1** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on multiple projects (mainly from college).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning both soft skills (leaderships, public speaking, etc) and hard skills (script/programming language, animation, etc).
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my sleep deprivation because of my projects.
- ðŸ“« You can contact me by email: ronaldo.pangestu1@gmail.com or from my LinkedIn profile.
- âš¡ Fun fact: my prefered nickname is NRZero, but GitHub won't permit me, so i add the number 1 (one) just for formality
